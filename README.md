Anlax is a continent, from 1.9 million years ago. It sank underwater (called the 'Great Renewal'), at the end of the 4TH TITAN (500,000 years ago), causing it to disintergrate without a trace.
Towards the end of Anlax's life, The leaders of Anlax's 4 states formed a covenant to invest into fighters, Grandmaster Mages, and scholars to research into the solution to prevent this. This covenant was called the,
ANALYXIST
This is where your character comes in. You were hired by the ruler of Carelina, Deiel Brennestuhl, to research into the GREAT RENEWAL. It is your job to rescue Anlax.
